how are you doing
what's up
long time no see
it's a piece of cake
break a leg
let's hit the road
i'm all ears
the ball is in your court
bite the bullet
cut to the chase
don't cry over spilled milk
hit the hay
the early bird catches the worm
actions speak louder than words
a piece of advice
keep an eye on it
time flies
i'm on the fence about it
it's a win-win situation
the ball's in your court
it's a no-brainer
cross that bridge when you come to it
back to the drawing board
the more, the merrier
don't beat around the bush
all in good time
let's call it a day
better late than never
it's a small world
the devil is in the details
don't put all your eggs in one basket
take it with a grain of salt
you can't judge a book by its cover
actions speak louder than words
don't count your chickens before they hatch
burn the midnight oil
get your act together
catch someone's eye
a penny for your thoughts
break the ice
don't throw in the towel
jump on the bandwagon
a picture is worth a thousand words
let the cat out of the bag
hit the nail on the head
play it by ear
rome wasn't built in a day
two heads are better than one
it's not rocket science
every cloud has a silver lining
